# Beddit web API documentation (Beta)

[Beddit](http://www.beddit.com) is a sleep tracker device and mobile
application. It has an ultra-thin film sensor that you place in your bed, under
the bed sheet. All you have to do is to sleep on it. Beddit connects wirelessly
to your smartphone for a sleep analysis. It measures sleep stages, heart rate,
breathing, snoring, and more.

When Beddit user signs in to Beddit, all sleep data is automatically synced to
Beddit servers. The web API gives developers possibility to make applications
that use Beddit sleep data.
